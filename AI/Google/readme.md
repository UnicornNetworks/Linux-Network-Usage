>Here are some tools that can be used to monitor network usage over time in Linux: 
>nload: Displays network usage in real-time, including inbound and outbound traffic, total transferred data, and network usage min/max. To monitor a specific interface, use the -d option followed by the interface name. To change the refresh interval, use the -t option followed by the desired interval in milliseconds. 
>iftop: Displays bandwidth usage. 
>NetHogs: A "network top" tool that can identify bandwidth bottlenecks and redistribute resources among applications. 
>bmon: A bandwidth monitor and rate estimator. 
>vnStat: A network traffic monitor. 
>bwm-ng: Bandwidth monitor next generation. 
>ip: A network monitoring tool that can show and manipulate routing paths, devices, policies, and tunnels. 
>speedtest-cli: A tool for testing internet speed. 
>fast-cli: A tool for testing internet speed. 
>CMB: A tool for showing network speed. 
>iperf: A tool for measuring network speed between two devices. 
>tcptrack: A tool for testing network activity. 
>Some recommend using a combination of tools for network traffic monitoring. UI-based network tools can provide more effective network monitoring with powerful visualization capabilities.
